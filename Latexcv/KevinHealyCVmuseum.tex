\section{Education and Academic Career}
\raggedright	
\textbf{2015 - Present} Research Fellow in Zoology, Trinity College Dublin.
 \smallskip
\par{\fontsize{10.5}{10} My current position focuses on using the animal and plant demography datasets COMADRE and COMPADRE to test questions regarding how body size and trophic ecology effects lifespan evolution. Supervised by Prof. Yvonne Buckley (Trinity College Dublin) and Dr Salguero-Gomez (University of Sheffield).\bigskip}

\raggedright	
\textbf{2011 - 2015:} Ph.D. in Zoology, Trinity College Dublin. Title: “Predator-prey allometry across body size and interaction dimensionality”.\\ \par{\fontsize{10.5}{10} I investigated how various ecological and physiological traits, including visual perception, species lifespan and predatory traits, such as venom, define predator-prey interactions using comparative approaches across vertebrates. Supervised by Dr. Andrew Jackson and Dr. Andrew Parnell.
\bigskip}

%------------------------------------------

\textbf{2007-2011:} B.A. Mod in Zoology, First class honours and Gold Medal winner, Trinity College Dublin.
Thesis: "Fractal structure of intestinal parasite communities in field mice". (Overall mark of 82\%).
I investigated the body size distribution of intestinal parasites in the wood mouse (\textit{Apodemus sylvaticus}). This involved trapping in the field, dissection work, parasite identification, preservation and data analysis.
\bigskip

%------------------------------------------
\textbf{2010:} Ureka research position in SoMER program, National College of Ireland Maynooth.\\
\par{\fontsize{10.5}{10} Ten week program under the supervision of Dr. Christen Griffen investigating the evolutionary divergence of entomopathogenic nematodes. This work involved the construction of a phylogeny for a groups of entomopathogenic nematodes collected from Bull island Dublin using molecular techniques.}
\bigskip

\textbf{2006 and 2007:} General archaeological operator for Valerie J. Keeley Ltd.\\
\par{\fontsize{10.5}{10} I worked as a general operator on site for three months in 2006 and worked both on site
and in post excavation in 2007 for three months.

\par{\fontsize{10.5}{10} As corresponding and *Co-first author, I show that theropod dinosaurs of intermediate body size are more efficient scavengers than individuals at the extreme ranges of body sizes.

I co-conceived the idea and carried out the data collection, analysis and writing of the paper.}
